  <li>Click continue and review the info you entered along with the price. Refresh the page if you need to edit anything.</li><br>

<h3>Common Problems: </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). <b>This will be changed in v3 so that you will no longer have to allow popups (this is confusing for some users so it's best if we switch to a new method)</b></li><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. üîÑ</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer  (unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store). üëé</li><br>
</ul>
