<h3>
EdgyBot has been patched. ü§î<br><br>
My instagram account has been taken down for copyright, some bs about the Edgenuity logo showing in one of my highlights. üôÑ<br><br>
EdgePlus site is down for obvious reasons (can't be accepting orders and payment for a non-functioning product). ü§®<br><br>
Possible ETA of EdgyBot v3.0: End of Feburary, hopefully will be done in about a week ü§û<br><br>

<h3>Tool Description:</h3>
<p>EdgyBot: A partially AFK Edgenuity Bot brought to you by EdgePlus+. Works on many activities offered by Edgenuity. The bot's main purpose is to progress a user through the course time line while they do other non Edgenuity related tasks. It does all non graded activities (By itself) & for the graded activities (except assignments), it unlocks brainly and auto searches. It also has an auto answer function for quizzes and tests.</p>

</ol>
<br>
<hr/>
<br>

  <li>You have now installed EdgyBot!</li><br>
  <li>Time to move on to the next step: "How to activate EdgyBot"</li><br>
</ol>
<br>
<hr/>
<br>
<h3>3. How to activate EdgyBot:</h3><br>

<ol>
  <li>Enter your initials as they appear on Edgenuity. ( Example: If your name is John Smith, enter JS )</li><br>

  <li>Click continue and review the info you entered along with the price. Refresh the page if you need to edit anything.</li><br>

<br>
<h3>Common Problems: </h3><br>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). <b>This will be changed in v3 so that you will no longer have to allow popups (this is confusing for some users so it's best if we switch to a new method)</b></li><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. üîÑ</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer  (unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store). üëé</li><br>
</ul>
