<h3>Tool Description:</h3>
<p>EdgyBot is a mostly-AFK Edgenuity Bot brought to you by EdgePlus+. It is designed to complete most activities offered by Edgenuity. Its main purpose is to help progress users through their course timeline while they focus on non-Edgenuity related tasks. The bot can complete all ungraded activities on its own, and for graded activities (excluding assignments), it can unlock Brainly and perform automatic searches. Additionally, it features an auto-answer function for quizzes and tests.</p><br>
